0.7 Sat 20 Sep 2008
	- Completely new internal structure; modified API, now with a C<run_fork> wrapper.
	  Should address both the semicolon problem and the context sensitivity

	  previous API design will continue to work unchanged.
	- L<Exporter::Tidy> replaces some local code.
	- POD examples extracted and provided as files in an F<eg/> directory.
	  Yes, this is Kwalitee whoring. Hopefully I won't make changes to the docs
	  that I then forget to update in the F<eg/> copies. Yay for CPANTS.
