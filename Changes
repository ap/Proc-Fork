=head1 Revision history for Proc-Fork


=head2 0.800 (2013-01-02)

=over 4

=item * Completely rewrote and simplified internals.

All operation and error checking is now in a single function.

=back


=head2 0.71 (2008-09-22)

=over 4

=item * Brown paper bag release.

Forgot some mandatory parens. No idea why 5.8.8 didn't give me the syntax error that 5.10 detected.

=back


=head2 0.7 (2008-09-20)

=over 4

=item * Completely new internal structure; modified API, now with a C<run_fork> wrapper.

This should address both the semicolon problem and the context sensitivity problem pointed out on AnnoCPAN by dmcbride. Code written against the previous API design will continue to work unchanged.

=item * L<Exporter::Tidy> replaces some local code.

It's a very small pure-Perl module that shouldn't be a dependency burden, and it's a good design that deserves some advertisement.

=item * POD examples extracted and provided as files in an F<eg/> directory.

Yes, this is Kwalitee whoring. Hopefully I won't make changes to the docs that I then forget to update in the F<eg/> copies. Yay for CPANTS.

=head2 0.61 (2007-12-23)

=item * Test suite fix attempt: in Perl 5.5.5, C<t/01.real.t> would generate the TAP header multiple times
